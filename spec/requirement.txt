Goal:
Preparing a basic java code that will use hashmaps to store the shift schedule for multiple teams where we can define constraints and team members



Separate classes for:
1. Team : having field for name and description 
2. Shift : having field for name, alias, start-time, duration_min, list of applicable weekdays
3. Member : having field for name, gender, team_name, list of applicable shifts
4. AssignedShift : having field for  member_name, date, shift_alilas



Execution flow:
1. Take a start date and end date for preparing the shift schedule
2. Randomly assign shift to team members for each day between start date and end date
3. Shift assigned to team members should be based on their applicable shifts
4. Finally output the shift schedule in a html table with dates on top, member names on left and their assigned shift in respective cell
